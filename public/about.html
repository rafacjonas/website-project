    <h2>Employment</h2>
    <h3>IT Specialist, Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
    <h4>Nov 2016 - April 2024</h4>
    <h5>IBM</h5>
    <p>
        Full Stack Web Developer, responsible for maintaining and upgrading 
        enterprise web applications. Working in the Financial and Operations 
        business unit for 7 years, I developed great skills in solving problems 
        and implementing high intensive data application solutions to a 
        large variety of customers (Dell, Apple, Deutsche Bank, Lenovo).
        My most commonly used languages are Java 6 versions to 17 (SE, EE 
        with Spring 3 framework), JavaScript, PHP (6 to 8.1), React (NextJS), 
        TypeScript and Node.js. I have skills constructing continuous delivery / 
        integration pipelines (Jenkins, Travis) and deep knowledge on cloud 
        architectures (IBM Cloud, OpenShift) using containerized solutions 
        (Docker, Kubernetes).
    </p>
    <p>
        My most recent accomplishment was the migration of legacy post-
        sales customer support software from a bare metal infrastructure to 
        the IBM Cloud environment. This effort resulted in significant cost 
        savings as I collaborated directly with clients to modernize their 
        interfaces.

        I also possess valuable experience in security aspects, including 
        mutual authentication, TLS/SSL implementation in HTTPS/SOAP web 
        architectures and MQ, as well as advanced knowledge in databases 
        and cloud sysadmin. Currently, I perform my role not only as a 
        developer but also as a team lead with comprehensive software 
        engineering skills and agile methodology.
